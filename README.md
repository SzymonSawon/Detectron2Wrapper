# Detectron2Wrapper
## Description

This project aims to simplify the usage of Detectron2, one of the most advanced libraries for object detection and image segmentation. With Detectron2Wrapper, you can easily implement and test key functionalities of Detectron2 without delving into the complexities of the underlying source code.

## Getting started
Main function serves as an example of how to use the wrapper. All necessary functions are called in there.

## Functionalies

### Configuration
You can change many parameters when initializing config
You can choose from all available Detectron2 models
### Training
You can easily train using few functions from file training.py
### Evaluation
You can evaluate with different evaluators
### Prediction
You can predict and visualize it
### Image augmentation
You can augment and then preview data.
### Image Visualization
You can visualize using:
- Images
- Videos
- Webcam for live detection
